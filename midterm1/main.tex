\subsection*{Part a), setting up the basis.}
    Since we use hydrogen-like single particle states, we consider the quantum numbers $nlm_l sm_s$. We constrain ourselves to only look at $n = 1,2,3$, with $l = 0$ implying $m_l = 0$ In addition, since electrons are fermions, all single particle states (SPS) must have $s = \sfrac{1}{2}$, giving two possible spin projections $m_s = \sfrac{1}{2}, -\sfrac{1}{2}$, which we will write as $\uparrow, \downarrow$ respectively. Due to these restrictions, the only relevant quantum numbers are $nm_s$.       
    
    We begin by setting up an ansatz (educated guess) for the helium ground state $\gs$. The one body energy $\inner{i}{\hnull}{i}$ is increasing with $n$, thus it makes sense that the lowest energy multi particle state (MPS) should prioritize the $n = 1$ SPS. No two fermions can be in the same state, thus setting both electrons in $n = 1$ requires antiparallel spin. Thus, using the creation and annihilation operators ($\crt{nm_s}, \ani{nm_s}$) from the second quantization formalism, we conclude:   
    \begin{align*}
        \gs = \crt{\ups{1}}\crt{\downs{1}}\vac
    \end{align*}
    With $\vac$ representing the vacuum state. Working with $\vac$ becomes cumbersome when we wish to look at excitations of $\gs$, especially if $\gs$ contains many electrons. Therefor we "redefine the vacuum", that is set $\gs$ as the Fermi level. This means that we will add and remove particles from $\gs$ to represent excited states, instead of constructing these from $\vac$. This introduces the language of \textit{particles} and \textit{holes}. A particle state is a filled state above the Fermi level, that is adding a $n = 2$ or $3$ state to $\gs$. On the contrary a hole state is a non-filled state below the Fermi level, that is removing one of the $n = 1$ electrons from $\gs$. We will refer to hole states using letters $i,j,k, ...$ and particle states using letters $a,b,c,...$.
